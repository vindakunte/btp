# Bachelor's Thesis Project
This is a study of Graph Neural Networks to predict the HOMO-LUMO energy gap of a molecule given its structure. The RDKit and OGB packages are used to handle molecular features and graph-structured data. Using PyTorch Geometric a graph isomorphism network(GIN) and a graph convolutional network(GCN) are trained
